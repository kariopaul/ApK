<div><h1>Instructions For Aporak Fiscal Model</h1></div>

<div><h2>1. DATA ENTRY</h2>
		<P>All blue texts are data that have been entered already. The user should change the 	entry to fit their objectives. Grey cells require user input for the model to work.</P>
</div>

<div><h2>2. FORMULAS, ADDING ROW OR COLUMNS TO SHEETS</h2>
		<P>Formulas should not be changed. No rows or columns should be added near to model structures.</P>
</div>

<div><h2>3. MAIN PAGE</h2>
	<h3>a. Model Pane</h3>
<img src="images\ModelPane.png" alt="Enter Model Parameters" style="width:800px;height:232px;">

<P>Select Case to Run: This is a drop down box of the different scenarios outlined on the assumptions page. This should read baseline, optimistic, conservative 1, and conservative 2. After entering data that describes each case, you then select which case you want to run, after which you press the refresh button to see the results of your model.</P>

<P>End of Last Fiscal Year: Enter the date of the last fiscal year for which you have data. This date will be automatically added throughout the sheet.</P>

<P>Number of Revenue Items: Enter the number of revenue items that you will be forecasting. Aporak's proprietary macros will create the necessary changes on the model and assumptions pages (including adding rows and adjusting formulas). You will then need to go to the assumptions page to enter your forecasts, and determine which type of forecasts you will be providing (more on this in section 4 a.).</P>

<P>Number of Cost Items: Insert the number of cost items that you will be forecasting. Aporak's macros will create the space for these items on the assumptions page and on the model page. You will then have to go to the assumptions page to enter the forecasts for these items as well as select the type of forecast you will be providing.</P>

<P>Number of Forecast Period: Insert the number of years you want to forecast. Again the Aporak's macros will extend and contract the model as necessary. You will then need to go to the assumptions page and enter your forecasts and select forecast type.</P>

<P>Units: This is a drop down box of the units of the data that you will be inserting in the model. The unit selected will be applied throughout the model for consistency.</P>

	<h3>b. Macroeconomic Data Pane</h3>
<img src="images\MacroData.png" alt="Enter Macroeconomic Data" style="width:665px;height:145px;">

<P>Nominal Gross Domestic Product: This represents the nominal gross domestic product on a fiscal year basis. The units used here follow from the units entered in part 3a.</P>

<P>Inflation Rate: This is the 12-month percentage change in prices over the course of the fiscal year.</P>

<P>Real Gross Domestic Product: This is the percentage change in real gross domestic product over the course of the fiscal year.</P>

<P>Exchange Rate: This is the end of period exchange rate of the local currency versus the US dollar.</P>

<P>Local Currency: This is a drop down box of the local currency of the fiscal accounts. Please select your local currency here from the drop down box. If it is not there it will be added, send us an email at kariopaul@hotmail.com.</P>

	<h3>c. Sovereign Credit Risk Parameters</h3>
<img src="images\CreditRisk.png" alt="Enter Credit Ratings">

<p>Credit Risk Rating: Here you enter the credit rating assigned by the various credit rating agencies. Both LC Debt —local currency debt and FC Debt —foreign currency debt are needed. Upon clicking the cell a drop down box will be presented. You will have to select the rating from the drop down box. You will also need to insert the date of the last credit rating update.</p>

	<h3>d. Interest Rate Build Up</h3>
<img src="images\IbuildUp.png" alt="Determine Yield Curve Parameters">

<p>5Y CDS (basis points): This is the 5 year credit default swap spread in basis points. We use this variable to determine the yield curve for dollar denominated sovereign bonds. To use the 5 Year CDS you go to the "Use?" column and insert 1 otherwise enter 0. Both the 5 Year CDS and the 10-Yr US Spreads should not have a "Y" at the same time.</P>

<p>10-Yr US Spreads: This is the 10 year US dollar denominated sovereign bond spread relative to rate on US treasury bonds of similar tenor. To use the 10 Year spread to treasury, you enter a 1 in the "Use ?" column. Both the 5 Year CDS and the 10-Yr US Spreads should not have a Y at the same time. Note that to use your own global bond yield curve enter no for both spreads and move to the assumptions page to enter your own yield curve.</P>

	<h3>e. Debt Modelling Parameters</h3>
<img src="images\DebtM.png" alt="Enter Maximum Debt for each bucket-% of GDP">

<p>Debt Modelling Parameters: These parameters determine the maximum amount of debt for each year for each bucket. There are 6 buckets available. For each of these buckets the maximum is determined as a percentage of nominal GDP for each year. In other words, the maximum determines the amount of debt for each bucket that the market will tolerate each year. Domestic debt are instruments issued to the local market, whilst external debt are instruments issued to the external debt capital markets. The debt check determines whether the maximum used is consistent with the historical pattern of debt accumulation.</p>

	<h3>f. Rank Order of Debt Repayment/Accumulation</h3>
<p>Paydown: The table allows the user to determine which debt bucket is pay down first, second, third, etc. The debt with the rank of 1 is paid down first, 2- second etc.</p>

<p>Accumulation: This table allows the user to determine which debt bucket is accumulated first, second, third etc.</p>

<p>The paydown and accumulated rank orders is tied to the debt modelling parameters. In the sense that each debt is accumulated up until they hit the maximum amount allowable. Each debt is paid until they hit zero before the next ranked debt is paid down.</p>

	<h3>g. Fiscal At A Glance</h3>
<p>Summary: This is a brief summary of the fiscal variables in the terminal year. The user should enter his/her targets for the various fiscal benchmarks in the grey shaded cells.</P>

	<h3>h. Debt Outstanding</h3>
<img src="images\DebtOS.png" alt="Enter figures for each debt bucket">

<P>This section defines the debt parameters used to model the debt over time. Data entered here must be the same as that registered at the end of the last fiscal year.</P>

<P>Currency: For this section please select either local currency for local currency debt or US dollars for foreign currency debt. Foreign currency debt issued in currencies other than the US dollar should be converted to US dollars, using the exchange rate as at the end of the last fiscal year.</P>

<P>Total Amount: Enter the total amount of debt for each bucket. Consolidation of the debt may be required.</P>

<P>Coupon/Interest Rate: Enter the weighted average interest rate for the bucket. The interest rate used is the coupon rate for bonds or the loan rate for bank loans.</P>

<P>Issue Date: Not required for this model.</P>

<P>Time to maturity: This is the weighted average tenor for the debt outstanding for each bucket.</P>

<P>Payment Frequency: Not required for this spreadsheet.</P>
<P>Interest Rate Spreads (Basis Points): Enter the weighted average spread for the variable rate debt bucket. Figures should be in term of basis points.</P>


<P>Amortizing Rate Per Year: This is the best estimate of the rate of principal outstanding that is required to be repaid each year. A weighted average estimate can be used here.</P>

<P>Type of Spread: This is a drop down box of the various reference rates that are usually used for variable rate debt repricing. Select the reference rate that corresponds with the debt instrument that has the largest weight in the bucket. The type of reference rates are 3-month local treasury bills, 6-month treasury bills, US 3 month LIBOR, and US 6 month LIBOR. </P>

<P>Type of Debt: Not relevant for this spreadsheet.</P>

<P>Resid/Non-Resid: Select to identify whether debt is domestic or external.</P>

<div><h2>4. ASSUMPTIONS PAGE</h2>
	<h3>a. General</h3>
	<img src="images\GenAss.png" alt="Select type of forecasting method">

	<h3>b. Yield Curve</h3>

<p>Yield Curve Data: Enter the yield for each respective tenor and for each forecast period. Yield curve forecasts can be obtained from the current yield curve by using the bootstrapping method to obtain implied forward rates. The benchmark tenors can be changed to your preference, the model with automatically interpolate between the rates using an Aporak's non-linear interpolation techniques.</p>

	<h3>c. Revenue and Cost Items</h3>
<p>All revenue and cost line items are determined by the IMF standard on Government Statistics. The link for the Government Finance Statistics Manual (2014) is here. After outlining the number of revenues and cost items on the main page, the model will create the slot for you on the assumptions page, you can then select which revenue and cost items you need from the drop down list.

<div><h2>5. MODEL</h2>
<p>Enter historical data in the grey cells, all the data will become blue representing data entered.</p>

<p>Importance of Refreshing Model: After each change to the model page click the refresh button to obtain the most recent projection. Without refreshing the model, the model will produce incorrect results.</p>

<p>Do model Check at Line 99: The model check line should show "Ok". If this is not the case then something may be wrong with the size of the debt bucket chosen. It could also mean that one of the formulas have been tampered with. Please contact customer success if you run into road blocks here.</p>
